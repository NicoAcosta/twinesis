## What is TWINESIS?

Introducing Crib Music: House music with extra sauce

TWINESIS, (Twin+Genesis), is the first official NFT collection from Twinny Twin + 3 song instrumental EP, named after this collection including 222 total 2D animations all created by Twinny Twin. This will be the first official introduction to the House sub-genre "Crib Music", as well as the beginning of a bigger musical and artistic journey.

Crib, being slang for house, or home fits well, hint the hip-hop influence in his expression of house music. Each NFT is a representation of beginnings, encompassing the city of St. Louis, Twinny Twin's hometown, inside of his logo as a celebration of the place that is responsible for his foundation. Here's your chance to join his and the journey of others. It all starts here.
